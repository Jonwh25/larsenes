The wind wyrms last for the spell&rsquo;s duration and do not fill the space they occupy. On the turn the wyrms are summoned, and as an action on subsequent turns, you may move the wyrms up to 30 feet to a space you can see. The wyrms may not move if they are restraining a target.</p>\n<p>As part of the action to summon or move the wyrms, you can batter a target whose space they occupy. The target must make a <strong>Strength saving throw</strong>. On a failed save the creature takes <strong>3d8</strong> bludgeoning damage and become restrained for the spell&rsquo;s duration. On a successful save the target takes half as much damage and is not restrained. A huge or larger creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. On your turn, you may release a creature restrained by the wyrms, no action required.</p>\n<p>A creature restrained by this spell may use its action to attempt a <strong>Strength saving throw versus the spellcaster&rsquo;s save DC</strong>, ending the restrained condition on a success. If a creature is falling or flying and becomes restrained by this spell, they remain at their current altitude and do not begin falling.</p>\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by <strong>1d8</strong> for each slot level above 3rd. When casting this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, or 9th level, you may restrain huge or gargantuan creatures, respectively.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"L’Arsène’s Ludicrous Larceny","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":60,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["3d8","bludgeoning"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"str","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":3,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"level","formula":"1d8"},"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Lh5pfUwqYBvIlqqt":3},"flags":{"mess":{"templateTexture":""}}}
